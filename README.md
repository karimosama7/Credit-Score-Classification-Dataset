# Credit Score Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying credit scores using various machine learning models. By analyzing demographic and financial features, we aim to predict credit scores accurately. This project is a practical application of machine learning techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Credit Score Classification Dataset**, which contains various features related to individuals' demographics and financial status. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we explored the dataset to gain insights into the features:

- **Age Distribution**: Analyzed using box plots to identify trends and outliers.
- **Income Analysis**: Visualized income distributions across different demographics.
- **Categorical Features**: Investigated features like Gender, Education, Marital Status, and Home Ownership.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored correlations between features to inform model selection.

## Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented to classify credit scores:

1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier
6. AdaBoost Classifier
7. XGBoost Classifier
8. Voting Classifier (ensemble method)

## Model Performance

The models achieved the following accuracies:

- SVC: 88%
- KNN: 88%
- Decision Tree: 94%
- Random Forest: 94%
- Gradient Boosting: 94%
- AdaBoost: 96%
- XGBoost: 96%
- Voting Classifier: 94%
